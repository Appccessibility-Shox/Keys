An accessibility tool that doesn't look like an accessibility tool, Keys for Safari is a browser extension that lets users <b>keyboard-navigate</b> the web by dynamically generating and rendering shortcut keys in the least ugly/confusing way possible.

If you have a motor disability or other accessibility issue, please email keys4safari@gmail.com for 100% off this extension. No questions asked.

All proceeds are donated to the Durham Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, a grossly underfunded public nursing home in Durham, North Carolina.
