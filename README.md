An accessibility tool that doesn't look like an accessibility tool, Keys for Safari is a browser extension that lets users <b>keyboard-navigate</b> the web by dynamically generating and rendering shortcut keys in the least ugly/confusing way possible.

## Now available on iPad!

Keys is now available on iPad, making it the first and only (to our knowledge) keyboard-navigation extension available on a mobile device. Keys + iPad is an incredible combination, particularly if your keyboard case doesn't come with a trackpad (such as the Smart Folio case doesn't). And since the iPad is an incredibly popular device among those with accessibility needs, Keys is now able to reach more of its most important users.
