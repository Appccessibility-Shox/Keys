An accessibility tool that doesn't look like an accessibility tool, Keys for Safari is a browser extension that lets users <b>keyboard-navigate</b> the web by dynamically generating and rendering shortcut keys in the least ugly/confusing way possible.

If you have a motor disability or other accessibility issue, please email keys4safari@gmail.com for 100% off this extension. No questions asked.

All proceeds are donated to the Durham Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, a grossly underfunded public nursing home in Durham, North Carolina.

## Now available on iPad!

Keys is now available on iPad, making it the first and only (to our knowledge) keyboard-navigation extension available on a mobile device. And Keys + iPad is an incredible combination, particularly if your keyboard case doesn't come with a trackpad. And since the iPad is an incredibly popular device among those with accessibility needs, Keys is now able to reach more of its most important users.
